Your project overview and implementation results are well-described. However, there are a few adjustments and clarifications I'd suggest for your README file to enhance clarity and correctness. Here's a revised version:

# GPT from Scratch

This project aims to understand and implement a basic Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. Following Andrej Karpathy's instructional video, ["Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=3656s), I developed a foundational understanding and constructed an initial version of a GPT model. This video serves as a comprehensive guide for building a GPT model from scratch. To further refine my implementation, I consulted the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture/tree/master) associated with Karpathy's lecture. I noted several significant updates in the repository, including adjustments to the learning rate, changes to certain axes' naming conventions, and the addition of a weight initialization function. These updates were integrated into my project to align with the latest recommendations.

The implementation utilizes character-level tokenization and leverages a Shakespeare corpus as training data. Below is a sample output from the model:

```
Lord Marshal:
O, Exeter: God put us my chamberholdren,
To yield him henceforth to plant and promony!

DUCHESS OF YORK:
Good it night, 'sail! mit makes me content.
The renormeth shall poor It dear that leven,
And let my sover joys was defended with steel,
Even I heard the issue: bear her up well.
I'll go thank you 'not, my fair lords, if
thou shalt not force it, 'since it before
You might want before I am! they should have employ'd,
As my soul to fresh wate: yet them admits--
Look you by the vower.

ISABELLA:
O, wife, beseech you, sir, brother.
What's the dupty bands me with you, and will come;
Not like so. Pray you, my facts!
First, and to leap, signify your soul!
Ton serves me to unto myself: all this maid
Your bids are mask; if I will renown
His complaint peace.

AUTOLYCUS:
Well, gentle kneer you hither.

Clown:
Madam, his way. Come along, welcome.

Shepherd:
Learnty. We'll see the sea your youngness,; that's not
so. They say, but such a plaisbing.

Shepherd:
Take your will to your gone, and shall't not off your ages,
So please you of the heap. O, sir, you must, mine
Must joy imports, and you and prosperish off your face
Of neceditation more might her precious,
Be sickness in standing, why would you speak,
And what live children buy the air,
Right to go the will of the king
Golden save way to women, that you may say
Now, but yet never told, the drop of the sea.
The king marken'd my life doth howe
Dare and record hath since I deposed.
What say you do I hear? why? cause else!
Where now, good wilf?

First Servant:
Lo, your grace? or take you, sir,
You so reported so repeased
Uon yet it, did not it: and yet, I,
Were put outto depose object
To a tapster of the secrets,
Necedled: such a day fitness of
Shadow down this world; and mark who 'tis my fond,
Supply but there's month that the gasp of heaven
Tell me whereof I have nothing shall have
All seas done to make it.
```

The model demonstrates an ability to generate text that stylistically resembles the training data, albeit without coherent meaning. This outcome is partly due to the use of character-level tokenization, which, while simpler, lacks the sophistication of more advanced tokenization methods. Improvements in tokenization and a more comprehensive pretraining phase could potentially enhance the model's ability to generate meaningful text.
